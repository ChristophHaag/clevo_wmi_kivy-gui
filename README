This is a GUI for Clevo Notebooks with a backlit keyboard with controllable LEDs.

It requires kivy for python 3 (python 2 probably works too) and this kernel module: http://sourceforge.net/projects/clevo-wmi/

Why a GUI?
The module requires to echo a 3-bit string like "010" to /sys/devices/platform/clevo_wmi/kbled/{left,middle,right} and it isn't even sorted as RGB.

Plans for this GUI:
Tray
Save/Load Config
Do the stuff in a maintainable way
